;;; 5.4. Compression

#|
A MySQL Compressed Packet consists of:
• 3 bytes        - length of packet (compressed)
• 1 byte         - sequence id (reset with, but independent of the wire-packet sequence-id)
• 3 bytes        - length of packet (uncompressed); 0 means payload was not compressed
• string[length] - the payload

The MySQL Compression Protocol is independent of the MySQL Wire Protocol
and is implemented here as a Gray stream that wraps the connection stream.

The wrapping occurs after the MySQL Handshake is complete if compression
is supported by the server and this library.

This functionality depends on the CHIPZ (decompression) and
SALZA2 (compression) libraries.

NB: A future version of this library may support the Compression protocol
using CHIPZ without SALZA, falling back on transmitting packets
uncompressed, but for now using the Compression protocol requires both.
